This Python file contains two classes: Person and Student. The Student class inherits from the Person class.

## Person class
The Person class has two instance attributes: name and age. It also has a method called say_hello that prints a greeting using the name and age attributes.

## Student class
The Student class inherits from the Person class. In addition to the name and age attributes, it has a grade attribute. It also overrides the say_hello method to include the student's grade in the greeting.
